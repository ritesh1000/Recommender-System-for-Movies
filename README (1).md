# Movie Recommender System Using Python and Flask

Content-Based-Movie-Recommender-System-using-Flask

This application provides recommendation of movies in user interest. It will record the feedback from user and will provide the similar interest of movies in return.

Check out demo: https://movie-recommender-sys-ritesh.herokuapp.com/

The details of the movies(title, genre, Keywords, Ovrerview, Cast, Crew etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the TMDB id of the movie in the API.

## API Reference

How to get an API.

Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/, click on the API link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key. If you are asked for the website URL, just give "NA" if you don't have one. You will see the API key in your API sidebar once your request is approved.



  
## Lessons Learned

Similarity Score :

How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? Here we use the similarity scores.

It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.

How Cosine Similarity works?

Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
